## Part 1
We changed the name of the `start` parameter and its uses to `base`.

`vim` command sequence:

`vim DocSearchServer.java` `<ENTER>` `/start` `dw` `i base` `<ESC>` `n` `dw` `i base` `<ESC>` `n` `dw` `i base` `<ESC>` `:wq` `<ENTER>`


## Part 2
1. I would prefer to use the `scp` method (method 1) if I were working on a program that I was running remotely because I personally feel more comfortable with VS Code than I do with `vim` command sequences.
2. If the project/task is relatively short, I might use the `vim` command method instead, since it takes less time than the `scp` method. HOwever, if there are more changes I have to make, the `scp`/VS Code method would be more efficient than `vim`.
